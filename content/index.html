<p>Ben Lobban showed a keen interest in songwriting from the very beginnings of
  his career as a musician. He began writing enthusiastically as a child on an
  ageing acoustic guitar which belonged to his mother â€“ admitting many early
  songs were written despite a lack of required proficiency on the instrument.
</p>

<p>Since those early years Ben has matured into a creative and competent
  songwriter. He has written continually as part of bands as well as developing
  his abilities to produce material as an individual. Ever seeking new avenues
  of influence in his writing, he has tested his musical capabilities by
  becoming an accomplished player of many instruments and performing in groups
  as diverse as guitar-driven rock bands to steel pan orchestras.  </p>

<p>From 2011-2015 Ben studied popular music at Edinburgh Napier University.
  During his time at university he challenged and expanded his skills as a
  writer by studying jazz composition, film scoring, and electronic music.
  Pop music, however, has remained at the core of Ben's passion for writing
   and was the focus of his Major Music Project in his final year on the
   course.</p>
