<h1>Ben Lobban</h1>

<p>Ben Lobban showed a keen interest in songwriting from the very beginnings of his
 career as a musician. He began writing songs as a child on an ageing acoustic
 guitar which belonged to his mother â€“ admittedly before being able to play it
 with any proficiency. </p>

<p>Since those early years Ben has written continually as part of bands as well as
developing his abilities producing material as an individual. Ever seeking new
avenues of influence in his writing, he has tested his musical capabilities by
becoming an accomplished player of many instruments and performing in groups as
diverse as guitar-driven rock bands to steel pan orchestras. </p>

<p>From 2011-2015 Ben studied the Popular Music BA (Hons) course at Edinburgh
Napier University. During his time at university he challenged and expanded his
skills as a writer by studying jazz composition, film scoring, and electronic
music. Pop music, however, has remained at the core of Ben's passion for writing
 and was the focus of his Major Music Project in his final year on the course.</p>
